		<p>Over the course of a week, the lives of three teenage friends will suddenly change. James Tresswick (Joshua Payne) and Mark Vincent (Sebastian Gregory) are teenagers in their final year of school and the victims of Gary Parker (Michael Dorman) who raped both them when they were younger. They still live in fear of him after he is released from prison for this crime.
		A brain damaged teenage girl named Tanya who has gone missing is run down by a car and killed while walking in a pine forest. Later, wandering alone in a the forest, Mark secretly witnesses a man (Joel Edgerton) burying a body. The two friends decide to go dig up the grave to see what was buried, bringing along James' girlfriend Chasely (Hanna Mangan-Lawrence). To their horror, they partly uncover the body of a young girl and beside her is a small Canadian flag, implying she is a Canadian backpacker.
		After an aborted attempt at reporting the body to the police, they search for the presumed killer from Mark's knowledge of the vehicle as he saw it driving away from the forest. They place the Canadian flag on his four-wheel drive and then the two boys secretly enter his house. They find out his name is Ian Wright and see a picture of him with a woman and baby, presumably his wife and child. They later phone him and try to blackmail him into killing Gary Parker.
		Ian finds Gary and sees him going into a club, as he's leaving he is bashed by two men who tell Ian it was "for what he did". Ian helps him back into his car and holds a gun to his head and asks him to explain about "the kids" who want him dead. He forces Gary to find the teenagers and hunt them with his dog and crossbow. Ian follows them and shoots Gary's barking dog. Mark is shot with the crossbow and The teenagers manage to fight back. Mark eventually beats Gary to death with a rock. Just as Ian is about to shoot Mark, Chasely comes up behind him and hits him hard in the back with a pole, allowing the three to escape.</p>
